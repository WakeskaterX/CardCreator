#Card Creator

Card Creator is an app for creating cards from settings, fonts and images as a tool for a project I'm working on.

The goal of this application is to allow the user to simply update a JSON file, provide the images and fonts used by the renderer and
automate the creation process for making fully rendered cards and output the final image to another directory.

### Prerequisites:

You will need beforehand:
* Cairo (Get 1.12.X for Mac OSX, not 1.14.X as it has bugs where text is not right on Mac OSX)
