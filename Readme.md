#Card Creator

Card Creator is an application for automating card art creation from a google spreadsheet document.

It takes the data from the document and compiles it down to each card and creates the cards, and then sheetify packages them into sheets for printing.

The goal of this application is to allow the user to simply update a Google Sheets Doc, create images and fonts used by the renderer and
automate the creation process for making fully rendered cards and output the final image to another directory.
